Hi {{name}} ({{username}}),

You have been invited to setup an account on {{origin}} registered to your email {{email}}.

To sign up, you will need to create a passkey for your account. Passkeys are usually stored by a password manager or on your device (iCloud Keychain/Apple Passwords, Google Passwords, Bitwarden, etc.) and allow you to authenticate more securely than with a password across all of your devices.

To set up your account, open the link below on a device signed into iCloud, a Google account, or a third-party password manager:
