<p>Hi <strong>{{name}}</strong> (<strong>{{username}}</strong>),</p>

<p>You have been invited to setup an account on <strong>{{origin}}</strong> registered to your email <strong>{{email}}</strong>.</p>

<p>To sign up, you will need to create a <a href="https://www.passkeys.com/what-are-passkeys">passkey</a> for your account. Passkeys are usually stored by a password manager or on your device (iCloud Keychain/Apple Passwords, Google Passwords, Bitwarden, etc.) and allow you to authenticate more securely than with a password across all of your devices.</p>

<p>To set up your account, open the link below on a device signed into iCloud, a Google account, or a third-party password manager:</p>

<a href="{{registration_link}}">{{registration_link}}</a>

<p>Please note that this link expires after 24 hours. You can ask an administrator of <strong>{{origin}}</strong> to send you another link.</p>

<p><strong>Do not ever share this link with anyone else, as it will allow them to obtain access to your account.</strong> If you believe someone may have gotten access to this link, contact an administrator immediately so they can secure your account.</p>

<p style="font-size: small; color: #666;">You are receiving this email because an administrator requested to send you a setup link. Please do not reply to this email, as this inbox is not monitored.</p>
